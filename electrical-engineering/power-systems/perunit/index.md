# Per Unit

## General idea
The per-unit (p.u.) system expresses electrical quantities relative to chosen base values. It is used to simplify power-system analysis, especially in networks with transformers. This is the **standard industry approach** for power-system modeling and analysis.

When multiple transformers are present, interpreting actual impedances referred across different voltage levels can be unintuitive. By converting everything to per unit, transformers effectively 'disappear' in the equivalent circuit, and all quantities become comparable on a common basis.

Per-unit values are defined relative to selected base quantities (typically base power and base voltage), which are usually chosen to align with equipment ratings (usually 100MVA).

## Transformer impedance
Transformer impedance is commonly given as a **percentage impedance**, which is simply the per-unit impedance expressed as a percentage. These values are defined relative to the transformer’s rated base values.
