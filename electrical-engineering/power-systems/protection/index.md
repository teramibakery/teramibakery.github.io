# Protection

To select and coordinate protection equipment (i.e., circuit breakers and relays), we must determine where protection should be placed and how quickly it must operate. Because power-system equipment is primarily **current-limited**, protection studies focus on calculating **short-circuit (fault) currents** to ensure devices can detect, interrupt, and withstand faults safely and reliably.
